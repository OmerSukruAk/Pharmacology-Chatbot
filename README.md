## Project Aim  
This project leverages FDA's open-source APIs to provide answers to medicine-related questions. The API responses act as the knowledge base for this system, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.  

In addition, the chatbot periodically scrapes data from drugs.com and provides links where users can find more detailed information about the medicine directly on the website.

## Frameworks:
* Langchain
* FastAPI
* Uvicorn

## Requirements  
- **Python Version**: 3.11.7  
- **Dependencies**: All required libraries and their respective versions are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run the following command:  

  pip install -r requirements.txt
