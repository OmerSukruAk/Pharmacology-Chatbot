# Medicine Information Retrieval System using LLMs (OpenAI GPT4o-mini)

## Project Aim  
This project leverages FDA's open-source APIs to provide answers to medicine-related questions. The API responses act as the knowledge base for this system, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.  

In addition, the chatbot periodically scrapes data from drugs.com and provides links where users can find more detailed information about the medicine directly on the website.
